# The deck editor

The deck editor is used to layout printed pages. It is most commonly used to prepare a deck of related components. It can also be used to design [custom expansion boards](um-expansion-boards.md) when supported by a game's plug-in.

## The editor

The deck editor has three basic parts. The upper left corner lets you set basic properties of the deck, such as the paper size it will use. Below that are collections of objects that can be added to the deck, including shapes, text, game components, and game-specific tiles and decorations. On the right side is the page layout area. A tab strip allows you to add, switch between, and organize pages in the deck.

## Deck pages

Clicking the last tab in the page tab strip adds a new page. Clicking a tab's delete button removes that page; if the last page is removed, a new, empty page is inserted automatically. When designing large objects like game boards, you can [tile large pages](um-splitting-large-pages.md) over a number of smaller, printer-sized pages from the **Print** dialog.

## Adding content

Content is added by dragging it from the lists of objects on the left and dropping it onto a page. To move around a page, click any exposed paper and drag the mouse. Use the mouse wheel, or <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> keys to zoom in and out. Click objects to select them; drag to position them on the page. Using the **Deck** menu, you can flip and turn objects, change how they are layered, change their style, and perform other editing operations.

### Snapping and fold marks

Many objects use *snapping* to combine with other objects. For example if you drag one card face over another and release the mouse button, the new face will snap into place next to its neighbour. If these are the front and back of a single game component, fold marks will appear to indicate that the two faces should be folded together to create a single card.

## Game sensitivity

The objects available to a deck depend on the game it is set to use. This can be changed using the dropdown list in the deck's main settings. This will reload the tiles, decorations, and other specialty objects related to that game. If there is no such content, only the **Tools** and **Faces** object tabs are shown.
