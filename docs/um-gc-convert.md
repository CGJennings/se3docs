# Converting components

Some game components include a feature that allows them to be converted to another component type. For example, a first edition component might be convertible to a component for a later edition of a game. When such conversions are available, they will be listed under the **Edit/Convert to** menu item. If this menu item is disabled (greyed out), then no conversions are currently available for the component you are editing.

To *automatically covert the component you are editing to a supported type,* choose the desired type from the options in the **Edit/Convert to** menu, if any.

How thorough the conversion is depends on the plug-in author. A conversion might be basic, such as copying over the name and portrait, or sophisticated, such as translating between the two rule systems. In any case, it is recommended that you check the converted component carefully to ensure that rules, terminology, and other content still make sense and are consistent with the target game.

> Game components are also sometimes converted automatically when you open them. This is a different feature. It occurs when a plug-in author finds that the existing design for a component is too restrictive and they want to start over from scratch, but without breaking your existing files. This process is normally completely automatic; you may not even notice a difference. In some cases, you may be prompted to install a plug-in for the new design before the existing component can be opened.
