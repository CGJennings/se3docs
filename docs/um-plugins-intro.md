# Installing and managing plug-ins

With most applications, plug-ins are a way to add optional features. With *Strange Eons*, plug-ins play a more vital role because they are used to add support for creating components for specific games. With no plug-ins installed, you can only create generic tokens and decks. As a result, you'll need to get familiar with the plug-in system before you get very far.

## Installing plug-ins on your first run

Strange Eons doesn't support any games when first installed. The first time you run it, it will prompt you to open the [plug-in catalogue](um-plugins-catalogue.md) to add support for at least one game. When you agree, it opens the catalogue for you and applies a filter so that only games are listed. Once you select something and click on the **Download and Install** button, your chosen plug-ins will be downloaded and installed. Some plug-ins include installation notes that are shown in a dialog box. After reading the notes, click on the **Close** button to dismiss each window. Once all of the selected plug-ins have been installed, you will be prompted to [relaunch](um-plugins-relaunching.md). Click the link to continue, and after a brief delay you'll be ready to start working. (On some platforms the relaunch option might not be able to restart the application. Just restart Strange Eons manually after it exits.)

## Core components

The first time you run Strange Eons and open the plug-in catalogue, the catalogue will also silently preselect a special set of plug-ins called *core components*. These are plug-ins that provide part of the basic functionality of Strange Eons, but don't change very often. Making them a separate download means that you won't have to re-download them every time you update the application. Strange Eons has been designed so that it can still run without these core components, but with reduced functionality.

## Installing plug-ins

You can also install plug-ins anytime by choosing the **Toolbox/Catalogue** menu item. This opens the same catalogue dialog as above (without any filters applied). Clicking on a listed plug-in will show more information about it. Checking the box next to the listing selects it for installation. As before, choosing **Download and Install** will install your choices. Depending on the plug-ins you select, you may or may not need to restart Strange Eons afterward.

## Managing plug-ins

Installed plug-ins can be managed using the **Toolbox/Manage Plug-ins** menu item. This dialog lets you review installed plug-ins, disable or uninstall them, and assign keyboard shortcuts to "tool" plug-ins (these add items to the **Toolbox** menu).

## Updating plug-ins

You can check for plug-in updates manually at any time by opening the plug-in catalogue. Any plug-ins with updates available will be marked with a special icon. You can also ask Strange Eons to check for updates automatically at regular intervals. To enable or configure this feature, choose the **Toolbox/Updates** menu item. You can also use this command to be notified when the Strange Eons app itself is updated.

### Updating plug-ins after app updates

Whenever you first start Strange Eons after installing an update, you'll be prompted to open the catalogue and check for updates. It's a good idea: existing plug-ins may need an update to work correctly in the new version. As with the first run, a filter will be applied to hide some of the catalogue entries, in this case hiding plug-ins that are up to date.
