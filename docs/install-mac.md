# Installation on macOS

This page describes the steps needed to install Strange Eons on macOS PCs.

## System requirements

Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.8.3+ or 10.9+.

At least 2 GB of RAM recommended.

## Installation steps

1. [Download the macOS disk image](http://cgjennings.ca/eons/download/update.html?platform=osx) (dmg) file.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to mount the disk image. In a few moments, a Finder window will open showing the contents.
3. Double click to start the installer.
   **Note:** if the install package is unsigned, right click the installer and choose **Open**. Then click **Open** again to confirm that you want to run the installer.
4. An installation wizard will guide you through the rest of the process. If you are not sure what to do, stick with the default options. Strange Eons will be added to your **Applications** folder.

## Troubleshooting

Installation problems are rare but frustrating. If the installer fails to start or reports a corrupt file, it usually means that the file did not download correctly. Try downloading it again.
