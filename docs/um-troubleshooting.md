# Troubleshooting

## Graphics issues

Some Windows machines have weird graphics glitches when running Strange Eons, such as bits of the interface not being drawn or being drawn in the wrong place. If this happens to you, try these steps:

1. Update your graphics driver to the latest version. Once installed and the the computer reboots, try starting Strange Eons again.
2. If your computer has two graphics chipsets (one power saving and one high performance), make sure Strange Eons uses the high performance chip.
3. Right click on the shortcut icon that you use to start Strange Eons and choose **Properties**. Look for the field labelled **Target**. In this field you will find something like `"C:\Program Files\Strange Eons\bin\strangeeons.exe"`. Edit this by adding a space, then the following (all after the `.exe"`):
   `-J-Dsun.java2d.ddoffscreen=false`
   Click **OK** and try running the app again.
4. The option above seems to do the trick for most people, but i f that doesn't work, you can also try adding the following in various combinations to see if you can find one that works (put a space between each extra option, as well as between the options and the end of the `.exe"` bit):
   `-J-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true`
   `-J-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false`

## Error messages

### Not enough memory to complete the operation

This message indicates that Strange Eons is running out of memory. Memory is the temporary workspace that holds both the application and the data that the application works on, like the portrait images you load and the cards you create. When Strange Eons starts, a fixed limit is selected for the amount of memory it is allowed to use. This default limit depends on your platform.

When this message appears, you have two options: either use less memory at a time, or increase the maximum amount of memory allowed to Strange Eons. To use less memory at a time, close tabs that you do not need to have open. For example, if you are laying out a deck, just have the deck tab open and close any other files you are working on. You can also uninstall unused plug-ins, although most plug-ins donâ€™t use much memory unless you are actually using their features. You may find it useful to install the **Developer Tools** plug-in `eonscat:39f10fa9-6574-4be1-9dd6-3e658c9a6fd3` and then use the **Window/Memory Use** menu item. This will show you how much memory is being used at any given time so you can get a better idea of what is causing the problem.

If you continue to run into this message, you will need to increase the memory available to Strange Eons by modifying the [Strange Eons VM options](um-command-line-options.md). Here are some example settings:

`-Xmx1024m`
Sets a 1024 MiB (megabyte) limit, also known as 1 GiB (gigabyte). This is the usual default limit and is the lowest recommended value for running Strange Eons.

`-Xmx1200m`
Sets a 1200 MiB limit, or roughly 1.2 GiB. This is about the highest setting you can use on 32-bit Windows; the app may fail to start without an error message if a higher value is specified.

`-Xmx2048m`
Sets a 2 GiB limit (as 2048 MiB). This is usually plenty.

`-Xmx2g`
Sets a 2 GiB limit (as 2 GiB).

### The plug-in bundle X could not be updated

This indicates that you have downloaded an update for a plug-in that required a [relaunch](um-plugins-relaunching.md), but when \Strange Eons restarted it was unable to replace the old plug-in for some reason. To investigate, you'll need to check your plug-in folder. If the app finishes starting, you can do this from the [plug-in manager](um-plugins-manager.md). Otherwise, find the `plug-ins` subfolder inside your [inside your user folder](um-user-folder.md). You should find a file with the name indicated by the error message and the file extension `.autoupdate`. You will usually also find a file with the same name but no `.autoupdate`. For example:

```
DeveloperTools.seplugin 
DeveloperTools.seplugin.autoupdate
```

The file with the `.autoupdate` extension is the new plug-in, the one without is the old version. For some reason (file permissions, the file is open in another app, disk error) the old file could not be deleted. You will need to delete it manually, then rename the new plug-in file to remove the `.autoupdate` extension. If the file is locked by an application and you can't figure out which one, you can try rebooting your computer first.

## App fails to start

### After installing a plug-in

If the app won't start after installing a plug-in, it is a good bet that the problem involves that plug-in. As above, find the `plug-ins` subfolder inside your [inside your user folder](um-user-folder.md). Locate the just-installed plug-in(s) and delete them, then try starting the app again.

### After displaying a Fatal Error message

When this appears, SE will try to check for an updated version which might have fixed the error. If it finds an update, a link will appear at the bottom of the message dialog. Otherwise, you should choose the **Report a Bug**  button to submit a bug report, or [report it here](https://cgjennings.ca/contact.html). Be sure to include the contents of the stack trace box (use the small **Copy** button).
