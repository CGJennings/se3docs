# Installation on Windows

This page describes the steps needed to install Strange Eons on Windows-based PCs.

## System requirements

One of Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 10

At least 2 GB of RAM recommended.

A 64-bit processor (and 64-bit version of Windows) are recommended.

Before installing, it is a good idea to make sure that you have installed the latest graphics drivers for your graphics card. Check the support page of the Web site for your computer or graphics card manufacturer.

## Installation steps

1. [Download one of the Windows installers](http://cgjennings.ca/eons/download/update.html?platform=win): the 64-bit version if you have 64-bit Windows; otherwise use the 32-bit version.
2.  Start the installer by double-clicking it in your downloads folder or opening it from your Web browser.
3. An installation wizard will guide you through the rest of the process. If you are not sure what to do, stick with the default options.

## Troubleshooting

Installation problems are rare but frustrating. If the installer fails to start or reports a corrupt file, it usually means that the file did not download correctly. Try downloading it again. If it fails again, it may be corrupt on the server: [please report the issue](<https://cgjennings.ca/contact.html> ).
