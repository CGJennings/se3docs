# Plug-in Authoring Kit

The Plug-in Authoring Kit (PAK) is a project for Strange Eons that includes an extensive collection of sample code and other resources for plug-in authors. The latest version can be downloaded from the [Strange Eons download page](https://strangeeons.cgjennings.ca/download.html) (source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/CGJennings/se3docs/tree/master/Plug-in%20Authoring%20Kit)).

The PAK is divided into a number of subfolders:

Templates for creating the various icons and other interface graphics used in various parts of the application.

`Minimal Examples`

`Project Examples`
