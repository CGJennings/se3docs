# Welcome
*Strange Eons* is a design tool for creating custom content for board, card, and role-playing games. You can use it to expand existing games with your own content, or as a tool for prototyping new games from scratch.
## Downloading and installing
To get started, [download](http://cgjennings.ca/eons/download/update.html) the most recent version of Strange Eons available for your computer. For installation instructions, refer to the page for your specific platform:

[Windows](um-install-win.md)  
[macOS](um-install-mac.md)  
[Linux and other platforms](um-install-other.md)

## Running it the first time
Strange Eons uses plug-ins to support content creation for specific games. It doesn't come with any installed, so the first time you run it you will be prompted to install some [core components](um-corecomponents.md) and other plug-ins. This also happens whenever you update Strange Eons, since some plug-ins may need to be updated for the new version. Once these extra pieces are downloaded, the program will want to restart. Let it. Now you are ready to start creating!

**More info:** [Installing and managing plug-ins](um-installing-managing-plugins.md)

## What next?
Once you have a plug-in for at least one game installed, choose the **File/New** menu item and choose a type of game component from that game. (um-Can't find one? Choose the **Everything** category.) That will get you started making your first card or other component. [Come back anytime](um-index.md) when you want more information on particular features.
