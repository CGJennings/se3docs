# Multiple and Custom Portraits

This contains three examples you can right click and **Run**
to test some more advanced uses of portraits:

`multi-portrait-diy.js`  
Demonstrates how to create a component with more than one
portrait. Also demonstrates how to create a portrait that
the user can rotate.

`linked-multi-portrait-diy.js`
Demonstrates how to create a linked portrait. That is, a
portrait that uses the same image as another portrait,
but is drawn separately and has its own pan and scale settings.

`roving-portrait-region.js`  
Demonstrates how to create a portrait that can move to different
locations depending on how the user changes the game component
state.
