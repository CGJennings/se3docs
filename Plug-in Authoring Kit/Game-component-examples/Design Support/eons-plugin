# An eons-plugin file lists one or more plug-ins that are included in
# a plug-in bundle (.seplugin or .seext), or the theme class in a
# theme bundle (.setheme). It is not required for a library bundle,
# but can be included to specify a name, version, or icon. It can
# also specify details of the bundle's catalog description.
#
# Examples:
#
# Load a plug-in from the named script file:
# res://example/myplugin/myplugin.js
#
# Load a plug-in from the named class:
# org.examples.strangeeons.MyPlugin
#
# For details see the "Plug-in Root File" Wiki page .
