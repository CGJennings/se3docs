# Design Support

This demonstrates how to create design supports. A design support
is an extra user interface element that provides feedback on
the design. For example, if the design breaks one of the game's
rules, the design support could indicate that.

There are three examples you can right click and **Run**.
For each, be sure to edit the field to see how the design
feedback changes.

`design-support-diy1.js`  
Creates a simple support using the default "verbal feedback"
design support component.

`design-support-diy2.js`  
A more complex use of the same "verbal feedback" model that
highlights how the user's actions change the provided
feedback over time.

`design-support-diy3.js`  
Demonstrates how to create your own custom "view" (user interface
element) instead of the built-in verbal feedback component.
