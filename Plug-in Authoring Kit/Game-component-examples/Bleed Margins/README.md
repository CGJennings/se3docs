# Bleed Margins

This demonstrates how to include a bleed margin and/or rounded edges
in your component design. All of the interesting bits are in
`bleed-margin.settings`.

Right click and **Run** `bleed-margin-diy.js` to play with the example.
Then try the various **View/Edge Finish** options to see the component
with or without its bleed margin and rounded edges.

You can also try **View/Unsafe Area** and **View/True Face Edge**
to see the effect of these options. (Try enabling them with
**Edge Finish** set to **Include Bleed Margin** first.
