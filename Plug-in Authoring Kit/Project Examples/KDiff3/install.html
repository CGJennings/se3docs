<h1>KDiff3 Integration</h1>
Use <i>KDiff3</i> to compare files and folders in a project.

<h2>To Compare Files or Folders</h2>
To make a comparison, select either 2 or 3 files or folders in the project.
The selection must be either all files or all folders.
When selecting files, only text files are supported (anything that can be
edited with the code editor, such as script files, settings files, tile
sets, HTML, etc.). Right click and choose <b>Compare Files</b>. A new
<i>KDiff3</i> window will open to display the comparison.

<h2>KDiff3 Configuration</h2>
This plug-in requires that <i><a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/kdiff3/'>KDiff3</a></i>
be installed on your computer. The plug-in will look for <i>KDiff3</i> in
a platform-specific default location. If <i>KDiff3</i> can't be found there,
you will be prompted to paste in the full path to the binary executable.

<p><b>Note:</b> If for some reason you wish to change the <i>KDiff3</i> path manually,
you can do so by changing the value of the <tt>kdiff3-exe</tt> user setting.</p>
