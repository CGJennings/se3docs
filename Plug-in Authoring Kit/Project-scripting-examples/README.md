# Project scripting examples
This folder contains examples of scripts that are meant to be
copied into projects to help complete a task. A convenient
way to use such helper scripts is to turn them into
*automation scripts*. This is done by renaming the script
to change its file extension from `.js` to `.ajs`:
right click the script, choose **Rename**, then click on
the existing `.js` file extension to make it editable.
This has two effects:
 1. The script's icon will change to a robot to indicate its purpose.
 2. Double-clicking the script will **Run** it by default instead of **Open**ing it.

**Note:** Before running an automation script from an unknown source,
an important precaution is to open first to check that the code
isn't malicious.
