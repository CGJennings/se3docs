# Various other scripts
This folder contains scripts that either don't fit neatly into
the main goals supported by the Plug-in Authoring Kit
(writing plug-ins and automating project tasks). It contains
the following kinds of material:

 - Advanced features that are not needed by those who are new
   to Strange Eons scripting, and which might therefore
   overwhelm them with too much information.

 - Niche techniques that fall outside the needs of typical
   script writing.
