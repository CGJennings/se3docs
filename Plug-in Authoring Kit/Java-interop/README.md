# `java-interop`
This folder contains scripts that comprise a set of 4
short lessons that will teach you the basics of accessing
Java code (like Strange Eons) from a script (like most
plug-ins).

The lessons are:
 1. How to access the Strange Eons application and other Java objects.
 2. About Java classes and packages and how to use them from scripts.
 3. Calling methods with the correct types and calling overloaded methods.
 4. Advanced: implementing Java interfaces and subclassing Java classes.

Since many of the examples in this kit make use of these techniques
(sometimes obviously and sometimes not), the lessons assume little or
no knowledge of scripting for Strange Eons.
You can dive in when and as needed.
