This folder contains image files that may be helpful in preparing new plug-ins:

blank-editor-icon.png      A blank icon for editors (and categories) in the
    New Component Dialog. (The icon for an editor is set in the .classmap
    file.)

category-banner.jpg      An image sized for use as a category banner in the
    New Component Dialog. (A banner for a category is set in the .classmap
    file.)

expansion-icon.psd      An image that can be used to create the small icon
    for an expansion in an editor that can read Photoshop format files.

plugin-representative-image-sample.png      An example icon sized for
    use as the "representative image" for a plug-in. The easiest way to set a
    plug-in's representative image is to include a .png or .jp2 image in the
    same folder as the plug-in, and using the same name as the plug-in script
    (or class) except for the file extension.

project-icons.psd      Sample icons sized for use in the project view.

theme-frame.png      An image of the frame placed around the icon for the
    standard themes. Place this over your theme's representative image to
    make your theme icons consistent.
    

You can use these files (or derivations thereof) in your own plug-ins.
