<h1>Rise of the Servitors</h1>
<p>This plug-in adds support for the fan-made <i>Rise of the Servitors</i>
expansion for <b>Arkham Horror</b>. Reproduced below are the rules for this
expansion, as designed by Adam Prince
<a href='http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/17142'>and originally published on Board Game Geek</a>.
This new card design and adaptation for Strange Eons were produced by Chris Jennings as an
example for plug-in developers, with Adam's permission.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Arkham is under seige from Dark Forces beyond the ken of most men...but there are some desperate, villainous, or simply deluded servants
that toil for their Master's benefit.

<p><b>So here's the deal:</b>

<p>If playing Rise of the Servitors, the following changes are made:
<ol>
<li>Azathoth may not be the Ancient One this game. If randomly drawing, either remove Azathoth, or if drawn, play as normal (awww).
<li>Three Servitors are drawn at random at the start of the game. Place Encounter markers on each Home space to designate that a Servitor
resides there.
<li>Place 3 Doom Tokens (or reasonable proxies) eye-side-up below each Servitor.
<li>Play as normal! (almost).
</ol>

<p><b>So, what does a Servitor do? Here's the rundown:</b>

<p>Each Servitor has a special ability that benefits the Ancient One in some way. This comes into play during the Final Battle---for each
surviving Servitor, the Ancient One is boosted in some way. If all three survive, they become quite potent. If all three are defeated, the
Ancient One gains nothing. Easy peasy.

<p>Servitors are masters of their domains. This means Gates at their location <i>cannot</i> be sealed by <i>any means</i>. They can be closed as
normal, but never sealed. Also, each Gate has its difficulty to close increased by 2 (e.g., a -2 Gate would now be a -4). Finally,
Investigators combating Monsters at that location (not Servitors, only monsters) receive a -1 penalty to their Evade, Horror, and
Combat checks.

<p>Servitors are similar to Monsters, but are <i>not</i> considered Monsters. Therefore they are unaffected by anything that specifies Monsters
(so they are not removed by Mythos cards is in a certain location, do not get a Toughness boost from Shub-Niggurath, cannot be
targetted by Bind Monster, are not taken as trophies, etc.).

<p>Servitors can be fought as normal, and can be evaded at will. However, once you enter combat with a Servitor, you may no longer Flee
or Evade. Combat continues until the Investigator or Servitor is defeated.

<p>When a Servitor is defeated, it is not immediately beaten. Instead, flip one of its Doom tokens over (Elder-Sign-up). You may not
battle that Servitor again this turn. Only when all <i>three</i> tokens are flipped upside down is the Servitor beaten.

<p>Rumors are not played as normal using this variant. Things are tough enough as it is! Instead, when a Rumor Mythos card is drawn,
spawn Gates/Monsters/Clue Tokens and move Monsters as normal. However, instead of putting the Rumor into play, its text is
ignored. Instead, all Servitors <i>immediately</i> have one Doom token restored (i.e., flipped eye-side-up), unless already defeated
(i.e., all 3 Tokens show Elder Signs). Then discard the Mythos card (Rumors do not persist and have no Rumor effects).

<p>Combat may be different depending on the particular Servitor. Some, such as Carl Stanford, have more difficult checks. e.g., a Horror
Check -2 [3] indicates that the player must roll 3 successes to succeed at that check (instead of just one). Others have multiple
Horror Checks (like Victoria Glasser), where the (x2) means that the player must face 2 successive Horror Checks before beginning
Combat. They succeed or fail at both independently, and both are separate. So you cannot cancel both Sanity losses using a single
Flesh Ward spell if you fail---each loss must be handled separately.

<p><b>So, what good is beating a Servitor?</b>

<p>When a Servitor is beaten, it strikes a potent blow against the Great Old One they serve. They invested a fair amount of power in their
servant, and their loss weakens them temporarily. When beaten (i.e., all 3 Doom Tokens show Elder Signs):

<p>Remove a Doom Token (if able) from the Ancient One's Doom Track, and place it Elder-Sign-up on the Servitor's location. That location
is now sealed, and any open Gates are closed (and if so, the Investigator who beat the Servitor takes them s a Gate Trophy---no roll
is needed). Nothing can remove this seal---once the Servitor is beaten, the location remains Sealed regardless of any other effects.
So no Mythos cards can remove it, no rules can remove it---the location is permanently sealed for the remainder of the game.

<p>Do NOT draw a Mythos card this Mythos Phase. This means there will be no new Gates, no new monsters, nothing. The Investigators have
earned a little reprieve.

<p>Finally, if all 3 Servitors have been beaten, the Terror Track is immediately lowered by 2. Things look a little less bleak.

<p>So there you are. Rules for the Rise of the Servitors. Hope you enjoy it!
Thanks for taking the time to slog through all that.

<p>--- Gnarly.
