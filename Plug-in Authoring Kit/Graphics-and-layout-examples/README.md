## `painting-techniques.js`
See and experiment with various techniques you can use when
painting game components:

 - `AffineTransform`s (rotation, scaling, translation, etc.)
 - `Paint`s and `Gradients`
 - `Composite`s, including `AlphaComposite`s, Porter-Duff rules, and
   `BlendMode` composites like the layer blend modes in paint apps (darken, lighten, add,
   subtract, difference, multiply, screen, burn, color burn, dodge, color dodge,
   linear burn, overlay, hard light, soft light, linear light, pin light,
   vivid light, hard mix, reflect, glow, exclusion, negation, hue, saturation,
   color, luminosity).
 - Image filters (brightness, contrast, glow, drop shadow, convolutions
   such as blur and sharpen, colour manipulation, bloom, and special effects).
 - Stroking and filling lines, shapes, curves, and polygons.
