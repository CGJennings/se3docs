# Graphics and layout examples
These scripts demonstrate a wide variety of techniques
and effects that can be used when painting card faces.

Right click an example and choose **Run**, or double-click
to open example to see how an effect is achieved.

## `cloud-fonts.js`
Cloud fonts let you access thousands of free fonts on demand.
See how to iterate over available Cloud Fonts, request a specific
font family by name, register the font family, or get Font objects.

## `graphics-playground.js`
Experiment with card face painting code and see the results instantly
on a sample card.

## `image-filters.js`
Play with different graphics filters available in the Strange Eons API.

## `page-shapes.js`
Learn to use page shapes, which let you flow text within the confines
of a shape. Pages shapes let you fit text around other content or
implement artistic effects.

## `painting-techniques.js`
See and experiment with various techniques you can use when
painting game components:

 - `AffineTransform`s (rotation, scaling, translation, etc.)
 - `Paint`s and `Gradients`
 - `Composite`s, including `AlphaComposite`s, Porter-Duff rules, and
   `BlendMode` composites like the layer blend modes in paint apps (darken, lighten, add,
   subtract, difference, multiply, screen, burn, color burn, dodge, color dodge,
   linear burn, overlay, hard light, soft light, linear light, pin light,
   vivid light, hard mix, reflect, glow, exclusion, negation, hue, saturation,
   color, luminosity).
 - Image filters (brightness, contrast, glow, drop shadow, convolutions
   such as blur and sharpen, colour manipulation, bloom, and special effects).
 - Stroking and filling lines, shapes, curves, and polygons.
