# Basics of scripting
This folder contains example scripts that help to introduce some
features of the scripting language and related tools like the
Strange Eons script console. Scripting in Strange Eons uses
a variant of JavaScript, but if you have experience with
JavaScript in other domains (like the Web) there will be
differences. Getting familiar with the special features of
scripting in Strange Eons will help you to be more productive.

Double-click a script to open it in the code editor.
(Right click in the editor and choose **Run File** to run it.)

You can also run these scripts directly from the project tree
by right-clicking the script file and choosing **Run**.
