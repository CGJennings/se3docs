# Injected plug-in examples
This folder contains examples of `INJECTED` plug-ins. An injected
plug-in is one that extends the functionality of Strange Eons,
but that doesn't have to be explicitly activated by choosing
an item in the **Toolbox** menu.

## FTP Export Container
An export container is a method of packaging and storing a game
component when it is exported. When you **Export** a game
component and use the **Destination** option to choose either
**Files in a folder** or a **ZIP archive**, you are choosing
between two built-in export containers. This example adds
an export container that uses FTP to upload the results to
a server. Note that this is only intended to be an example,
and only basic FTP functionality is supported.
